You can start your process by submitting a web form.  
You can either utilize the auto-generated form or create a new form using `Plumsail Forms <https://plumsail.com/forms/>`_.

Use auto-generated form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process pulls tokens from your document template and creates a web form based on them. This auto-generated form will stay bound to the process.

You can modify it a bit and make it more user-friendly by changing token types.
