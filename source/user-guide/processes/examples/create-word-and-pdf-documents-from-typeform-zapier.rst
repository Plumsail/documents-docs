Create Word and PDF documents from Typeform in Zapier
============================================================

This article demonstrates how to create PDF documents from a DOCX template on `Typeform <https://www.typeform.com/>`_ submission with the help of `Processes <../../../user-guide/processes/index.html>`_ in Zapier. It may help you to automate the generation of different documents like applications, requests, orders, etc., in your company. 

**Processes** are a `Plumsail Documents <https://plumsail.com/documents/>`_ feature with an intuitive interface for creating documents from templates.

**Typeform** is an online form builder that allows you to create modern responsive forms for your website.

Letâ€™s see how to connect them in `Zapier <https://zapier.com/apps/plumsail-documents/integrations>`_ to automatically collect data from a Typeform, apply the data to our template, and generate a new PDF document.

Create a Form
-------------

We've already created a Typeform. We will use data from its submission in our Flow. If you haven't created Typeforms before, follow `this link <https://www.typeform.com/help/my-1st-typeform/>`_ to learn how to do it.

Below is a screenshot of our form:

Configure the Process
---------------------

Then, let's configure the Process, which will generate PDF documents from a DOCX template.

Create a new process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to `the Processes section <https://auth.plumsail.com/account/Register?ReturnUrl=https://account.plumsail.com/documents/processes/reg>`_ in your Plumsail account.

Click on the *Add process* button.

    :alt: add process button

Set the Process name. Select **DOCX** for a template type.

Configure a template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you're done with the first step *Create Process*, press the *Next* button, and youâ€™ll proceed to the next step â€“ *Configure Template*.

It includes two substeps:

- Editor;
- Settings.

In `Editor <../../../user-guide/processes/online-editor.html>`_, you can compose the template from scratch or upload a pre-made one. It's also possible to modify the uploaded template online.

Feel free to `download a DOCX template <../../../_static/files/flow/how-tos/Create-Word-and-PDF-template.docx>`_ that we're using in this example for demonstration purposes:

Then upload it to the process.

Tempating syntax
*****************
When creating your own templates, mind the templating language. Plumsail Word DOCX templates use a different approach than most other templating solutions. It uses a minimal amount of syntax to make your work done.

In short, the templating engine thinks that everything between curly :code:`{{ }}` brackets is variables where it will apply your specified data. 
Read `this article <../../../document-generation/docx/how-it-works.html>`_ to get familiar with the templating engine.


Test template
*************

You can test a template as well, to see how it will look at the end. After clicking on the *Test template* button, youâ€™ll need to fill in the auto-generated testing form. 
Fields of this form are created based on tokens from your document template. You can `adjust the look of the testing form by changing token types <../custom-testing-form.html>`_.

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/flow/how-tos/test-template-forms-processes.png
    :alt: test template

Itâ€™s testing. Weâ€™re going to apply the data from the Cognito form to our template. 

Once you've tested the template, press *Save&Next* to proceed further - to the **Settings** substep.

- Switch to an active mode to remove Plumsail watermarks from resulting documents
- Fill in the name of the result file
- Select PDF format for the output file
- `Protect the result PDF <../configure-settings.html#add-watermark>`_ if you wish

Delivery
~~~~~~~~

The next step is delivery. For demonstrating purpose, weâ€™ll store the result file in `OneDrive <../../../user-guide/processes/deliveries/one-drive.html>`_. But there are `other options <../../../user-guide/processes/create-delivery.html#list-of-available-deliveries>`_.

Select the folder where the ready document will be saved. Fill in the file's name.

You can configure as many deliveries as you need.

Start the Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We will start our Process from Zapier. 

Create a Zap
-------------

Zap is an automated connection between web services in Zapier. 
You can create it from scratch following the steps explained below.


Or you can utilize the zap template. Click **Use this zap**, and then just customize the steps as it's described further in this article.

|Widget|

.. |Widget| raw:: html

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://zapier.com/apps/embed/widget.js?guided_zaps=133662"></script>

This is how our Zap looks:

Below is a step-by-step description.

New entry in Typeform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need to start the Zap everytime somebody submits our Typeform. For that, search for  *Typeform* in Zapier and add *New entry* as a trigger.

If this is your first Zap with Typeform, on this step, sign in to your Typeform Account from Zapier to use your forms inside Zaps.

Then, you'll need to pick the form you want to track in the dropdown.

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/flow/how-tos/customize-test-typeform.png
    :alt: Typeform trigger

The last thing to do with the trigger - **Find data**. Press "Test trigger" to find data. It will allow you to use the trigger output on the next step.

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/flow/how-tos/test-typeform-zap.png
    :alt: Test Typeform trigger to find data

Start process in Plumsail Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the trigger is set, search for Plumsail Documents and add an action *Start process*.

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/user-guide/processes/how-tos/start-process-zapier.png
    :alt: start process from Zapier action

Click Continue. If this is your first Zap, at this point, you'll need to Sign in to your Plumsail Account from Zapier to establish a connection between the app and your account. If you already have a Plumsail account tied to the app, you can add another one at this step, and use it instead.

Customize Start Process
***********************

Choose the process you want to start by this Zap from the dropdown. 

You will see fields to complete - they have the same names as tokens from the template. 

To complete them, use the output from the Typeform trigger.

Our Zap is ready ðŸŽ‰ See how the resulting file looks:
