Plumsail Forms integration
==========================

Plumsail Forms are natively integrated with Plumsail Documents. You can bind the particular web form to the process right in your Plumsail account. 

Examples below will help you to get started with that:

- `Auto-populate fillable PDF from Plumsail Forms <../../../processes/examples/auto-populate-pdf-from-plumsail-forms.html>`_
- `Create Word and PDF documents from Plumsail Forms <../../../processes/examples/create-word-and-pdf-documents-from-plumsail-forms.html>`_

.. note:: You can also use `Zapier <../../../processes/examples/create-excel-and-pdf-documents-from-plumsail-forms-zapier.html>`_ or `Power Automate <../../../processes/examples/create-excel-and-pdf-documents-from-plumsail-forms.html>`_ to integrate Plumsail Documents and Plumsail Forms for, maybe, some advanced logic and connecting both systems to other web services.
