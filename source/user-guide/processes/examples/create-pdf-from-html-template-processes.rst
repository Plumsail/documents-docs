Create PDF document from HTML template in Zapier, Power Automate (Microsoft Flow), and Azure Logic Apps
=======================================================================================================

This article demonstrates how to generate PDF documents from an HTML template with the help of `Plumsail Documents processes <https://plumsail.com/docs/documents/v1.x/user-guide/processes/index.html>`_.

The Processes are a user-friendly intuitive interface for creating documents from templates, converting them, and delivering to different systems for further management.

In this article, we will generate a PDF invoice based on some data. This is how our final PDF file will look:

Here is a step-by-step description of creating a process of generating PDF documents from an HTML template.

Configure Process
-----------------

First, register or login to your `Plumsail account <https://account.plumsail.com/>`_. Then select *Documents* and go to the `Processes section <https://account.plumsail.com/documents/processes>`_. 

Create a new process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click on the *Add Process* button.

Give a name to the Process to recognize it later.

Upload the template you want to use. Here is `the link for downloading the template <../../../_static/files/flow/how-tos/html-template.html>`_ we are using in our case.

If you open this template you may see that there are placeholders like :code:`{{Total}}` and :code:`{{Quantity}}`. There is also :code:`#{{each}}` iterator for rendering invoice items. Please read `template syntax description <../../../document-generation/html/index.html>`_ for more information.

Configure template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you've created the Process and submitted the template, you'll proceed to the next step - **Configure template**.

Here you set the following parameters. Descriptions are under the picture.

   :alt: configure HTML2PDF template

**Template mode**

It is *Testing* by default. It means you won't be charged for this process runs, but result documents will have a Plumsail watermark. Change it to *Active* to remove the watermark.

**Output filename**

Use tokens to make it personalized. They work the same way as in the template. For instance, we use the following tokens to define the output file name - :code:`{{InvoiceNum}}`. As a result, we'll receive an invoice marked with its number - *Invoice 1*.

**Output type**

By default, it is the same as your template's format. In this particular case, it's HTML. We're changing it to PDF to create PDF documents from an HTML template.

.. hint:: You can `protect your final PDF document with a watermark, by setting a password, or disabling some actions <../create-process.html#add-watermark>`_. 

**Test template**

You can test the template to see how it will look at the end by clicking the *Test template* button.

After you click on the *Test template* button, you will see the dialog where you can insert your data in JSON format. This JSON data represents what will be pasted into :code:`{{ }}` brackets instead of object names and their properties. So, it must correspond to tokens from the template. 

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/user-guide/processes/how-tos/test-pdf-from-html-template.png

To test the template from our example, you can copy and paste the JSON data shown below.

.. note:: This is JSON for testing. You can pass data from an external system or web form to the process. See the `Start process section <#start-process>`_. 

.. code:: json

    {
        "InvoiceDate": "10/02/2017",
        "InvoiceNum": 1,
        "Total": 1098,
        "ClientCompany": "Contoso ltd.",
        "ClientName": "John Doe",
        "ClientAddress": "55 East 52nd Street 21st",
        "ClientCity": "New York",
        "ClientRegion": "US",
        "ClientZip": "10022",
        "Items": [
            {
                "FieldValues": {
                    "Quantity": 1,
                    "SubTotal": 499,
                    "Title": "Product Name #1",
                    "UnitPrice": "499"
                }
            },
            {
                "FieldValues": {
                    "Quantity": 1,
                    "SubTotal": 599,
                    "Title": "Product Name #2",
                    "UnitPrice": 599
                }
            }
        ]
    }


Delivery
~~~~~~~~

The next step is delivery. For demonstrating purpose, weâ€™ll store the result file in `OneDrive <../../../user-guide/processes/deliveries/one-drive.html>`_. But there are `other options <../../../user-guide/processes/create-delivery.html#list-of-available-deliveries>`_.

You need to connect to your OneDrive from the Plumsail account. After that, set the folder's name where to save the ready document. Here you can use tokens as well.

You can configure as many deliveries as you need.

Start the Process
-----------------

Now everything is ready, and you can start generating PDF documents from an HTML template. The step **Start process** will show available options with a description for each.

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/user-guide/processes/how-tos/start-html-process.png
    :alt: start process to create HTML from template

You can start the process :

- `manually <../start-process-manually.html>`_ with your JSON data;
- `by Plumsail Web form <../start-process-web-form.html>`_ bound to the process;
- `using Power Automate (former Microsoft Flow) <../start-process-ms-flow.html>`_;
- `using Zapier <../start-process-zapier.html>`_
- `using REST API <../start-process-rest-api.html>`_;

Use `Power Automate Flow <../../../getting-started/use-from-flow.html>`_ and `Zapier <../../../getting-started/use-from-zapier.html>`_ to connect the process with other apps. It enables you to gather data from one app and pass on to the process to populate a DOCX template. Thus, you can populate the DOCX template from various web forms, CRM systems, SharePoint lists, and thousands of other web applications. 

.. hint:: With Plumsail Processes, you can easily `create PDF documents from a DOCX template <../../../user-guide/processes/examples/create-pdf-from-docx-template-processes.html>`_ as well.

.. note:: There is another - a little bit more complicated - way to create PDF documents from the HTML template. Check `the article <https://plumsail.com/docs/documents/v1.x/flow/how-tos/documents/create-pdf-from-html-template.html>`_.
