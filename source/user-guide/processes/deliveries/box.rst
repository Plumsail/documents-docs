Box delivery
============

Box delivery saves a document generated by your process to a Box folder. 

After you select Box delivery, you'll be asked to connect to your Box account. Click 'Connect to Box' to proceed.

You'll see an authorization window asking to log in and grant access to Box.

Once you've authorized, specify the Box folder name where you'd like to store documents generated by this process:
