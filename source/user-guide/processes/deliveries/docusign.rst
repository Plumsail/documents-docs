DocuSign delivery
=================

The `DocuSign <https://www.docusign.com/>`_ delivery sends the resulting document to DocuSign for signing. 

First of all, you need to connect to your DocuSign account from the Plumsail account.

Here you can switch on Sequential signing, then just drag and drop recipients to define an order what they should sign the document in.

And you can set the expiration period and sending reminders. 

Use tokens inside email subject and body
