eversign delivery
=================

The `eversign <https://eversign.com/>`_ delivery sends the resulting document to eversign for signing.

To start with, you need to log in to your eversign account from the Plumsail account and authorize Plumsail Documents to access it.

In the screenshot above, you may see lock buttons. One is green, which means it's activated. Another is off.

Clicking on the lock, you can **set a signer PIN**. Signer PINs provide you with extra signer authentication and security.
