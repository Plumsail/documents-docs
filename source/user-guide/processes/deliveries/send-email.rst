Email delivery
==============

The Email delivery sends a file generated by your process as an email attachment. This is how the email delivery step looks:

Just fill **To**, **Subject**, and **Body** fields of delivery as you do in any email client. You can specify **Cc** and **Bcc** if need be.

Expand **Advanced** to set:

- **Display name**. The name which recipients see when receiving emails. Default is Plumsail Documents Delivery. You can define your custom Display name.
- **Reply-to**. The default is the currently logged-in user's email. It's possible to change it.

Use tokens to specify recipients
--------------------------------

You can either manually specify the email address

or enter the email as a token, if the token exists in the source template. 

The token may contain several comma separated adresses: *john.smith@contoso.com, adam.allman@contoso.com*
