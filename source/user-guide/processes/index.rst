Use Processes to create documents from templates
================================================

Processes is the easy way to automate creation of documents from templates in Plumsail Documents. 

You will generate and deliver documents in a few simple steps:

.. toctree::  
  :name: toc-processes
  :maxdepth: 1
    
  Prepare a template for your document <create-template>
  Create a new process <create-process>
  Test the template with your data <test-template>
  Configure how to deliver generated documents (email, OneDrive, etc.) <create-delivery>
  Start document generation using Plumsail Forms, Microsoft Flow or REST API<start-process>

.. note:: 

  Use Processes to easily create documents from templates, convert and deliver them. If you need some advanced operations on documents you should take a look at our `Microsoft Flow actions <use-from-flow.html>`_ and `REST API <use-as-rest-api.html>`_.
