Processes
=========

Processes are an easy way to automate the creation of documents from templates. You can generate and deliver documents in a few simple steps:

.. toctree::   
  :name: toc-processes  
  :maxdepth: 1
    
  create-template
  create-process
  test-template
  create-delivery
  start-process

.. note::

  Processes work for most of the scenarios. If you want some advanced operations on documents, take a look at our `Microsoft Flow actions <use-from-flow.html>`_ and `REST API <use-as-rest-api.html>`_.
