Fill in the process name and upload a blank file in a required format for future document template. It can be Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or HTML files - depending on what kind of a template you need. 

The processes support fillable PDFs as templates. If you have a PDF form as a template, upload it. 

Then click the *Create* button:

.. Note:: Once the process is created, you will proceed to `prepare and test the template <./edit-test-template.html>`_.
