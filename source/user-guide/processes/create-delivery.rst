Configure how to deliver generated documents
============================================

Once your document is generated you may want to save it somewhere or send it to somebody. That is where deliveries can help. You can save result document to OneDrive, Dropbox, send it by email, etc.

Click "Add delivery" button on the left side of your process. You will see list of available deliveries:
