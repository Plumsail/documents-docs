Use Microsoft Flow
==================

You can use `Plumsail Documents connector <https://emea.flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/shared_plumsail/plumsail-documents/>`_ in Microsoft Flow for two scenarios:

Start Process and generate document from template
-------------------------------------------------

`Processes <use-processes.html>`_ is the easy way to automate creation of documents from templates. You just configure template, test it and specify how to deliver results (email, OneDrive, etc.). You can use `Plumsail Documents connector <https://emea.flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/shared_plumsail/plumsail-documents/>`_ for Microsoft Flow to start a process. 

First, you need to `create an API key <../user-guide/api-keys.html>`_. You will need it in your flow.

Then add `Start process <#>`_ action to your flow. You will be asked for *'Connection Name'* and for *'Access Key'*. You can type any name for the connection. For example, *'Plumsail Documents'*. Then paste API key that you created earlier to *'Access Key'*.

Optionally, once the action is executed you can get result document as an output of the action and continue to work with it in your flow.

Here is an example of a simple flow that starts a process and then uploads it to OneDrive:

Review other examples of Microsoft Flows:

Advanced document processing
----------------------------

Sometimes, you don't want to use `Processes <use-processes.html>`_ to generate documents or documents are already generated by a third party system. 

In this case use `rich set of Microsoft Flow actions <../flow/actions/document-processing.html>`_ from Plumsail Documents connector. 

For example, you can:

- `Convert documents to various formats <../how-tos/documents/index-convert-documents.html>`_
- `Extract data from fillable PDF forms <../how-tos/documents/collect-data-pdf-form.html>`_
- `Protect PDF <https://medium.com/plumsail/how-to-protect-pdf-disable-printing-modification-annotations-set-password-in-microsoft-flow-and-e255100bd04e>`_ files and `add watermarks <https://medium.com/plumsail/how-to-add-a-watermark-to-a-pdf-document-using-microsoft-flow-azure-logic-apps-or-powerapps-48076779df83>`_
- `Split <../how-tos/documents/split-pdf-files.html>`_ and `Merge PDF documents <../how-tos/documents/merge-pdf-files.html>`_
- `Parse documents using regular expressions <../how-tos/documents/use-regex-match-to-extract-values.html>`_
- `Read CSV files <../how-tos/documents/read-a-CSV-file-and-bulk-generate-documents.html>`_
