================================================

First of all, `sign in <https://auth.plumsail.com/account/login?ReturnUrl=https://account.plumsail.com/documents/processes>`_  to Plumsail Account. If you don't have an account yet, then  `sign up <https://auth.plumsail.com/account/Register?ReturnUrl=https://account.plumsail.com/documents/processes/reg>`_. Then navigate to Processes:

Processes are an easy way to automate the creation of documents from templates. You can generate and deliver documents in a few simple steps:

.. We DO NOT use here toctree because we don't want to dublicate Processes navigation under Getting started section.

- `Create a new process <../user-guide/processes/create-process.html>`_
- `Prepare and test a template <../user-guide/processes/edit-test-template.html>`_
- `Configure output file format and other settings <../user-guide/processes/configure-settings.html>`_
- `Deliver generated documents (email, OneDrive, eSignature, etc.) <../user-guide/processes/create-delivery.html>`_
- `Start process (Web form, Zapier, Power Automate (Microsoft Flow), or REST API) <../user-guide/processes/start-process.html>`_
- `Review ready-to-use examples <../user-guide/processes/index.html#processes-examples>`_

.. note::

  Processes work for most of the scenarios. If you want some advanced operations on documents, take a look at our `Power Automate (Microsoft Flow) actions <use-from-flow.html#advanced-document-processing>`_ and `REST API <use-as-rest-api.html>`_.
