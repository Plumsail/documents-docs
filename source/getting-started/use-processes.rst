- `Test the template with your data <../user-guide/processes/test-template.html>`_
- `Deliver generated documents (email, OneDrive, etc.) <../user-guide/processes/create-delivery.html>`_

.. note::

  Processes work for most of the scenarios. If you want some advanced operations on documents, take a look at our `Power Automate (Microsoft Flow) actions <use-from-flow.html#advanced-document-processing>`_ and `REST API <use-as-rest-api.html>`_.
