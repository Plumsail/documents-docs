What are documents?
-------------------

Each run of Plumsail Documents processes means a single document. Thus, even if you use processes to create a document from a template, then convert it to PDF, add a watermark and protect your PDF - we charge for just one document because it's a single run of the process to complete all these actions.

As for actions from the Plumsail Documents connector for Power Automate (Microsoft Flow) and Logic Apps, there each execution is considered one document as well. For instance,  if you use the "Split PDF" action to split a single PDF document into a few separate documents; we charge for a single document only, because it is a single execution.

What happens when all documents are spent?
------------------------------------------

You can see usage stats in your `Plumsail Documents account <https://account.plumsail.com/documents/license>`_. If you see that you most likely reach the limit this month, you can purchase `additional 100 documents <https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=16287655&QTY=1&CART=1&CARD=2&SHORT_FORM=1&ORDERSTYLE=nLWonJWpmHI=&PAY_TYPE=CCVISAMC&SRC=documentation&BACK_REF=https%3A%2F%2Fplumsail.com%2Fstore%2F>`_ or pay a differential cost to `start using another plan <upgrade-renew.html>`_. 

The documents amount will be reset at 1st day in a month according to your current plan.
