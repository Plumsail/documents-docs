What are documents?
-------------------

Each execution of actions from Plumsail Documents is considered a document. Thus, even if you use "Split PDF: action to split a single PDF document into a few separate document, we charge as for a single document only, because it is a single execution.

What happens when all documents are spent?
------------------------------------------

You can see usage stats in your `Plumsail Documents account <https://account.plumsail.com/documents/license>`_. If you see that you most likely reach the limit this month, you can purchase `additional 100 documents <https://secure.avangate.com/order/product.php?PRODS=4724468&QTY=1&ORDERSTYLE=nLWonJWpmHI=&SHOPURL=https%3A%2F%2Fplumsail.com%2Factions%2Fstore%2F>`_ or pay a differential cost to `start using another plan <upgrade-renew.html>`_. 

The documents amount will be reset at 1st day in a month according to your current plan.
