All operations are performed over secure encrypted HTTPS connection. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties.

Log information
---------------

We are automatically gathering some data and store it in log files. This information includes several activities as internet protocol addresses, browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Our application log files are subject to the same strict data security policies and procedures as apply to the application databases for Documents. We do this to improve the support that we offer you. Log files are stored for a few days, then they are removed permanently.

Local storage
-------------

We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage. Local storage is located in client web browsers. We don’t transfer any data from local storage to our servers. It is used for performance optimization and caching. Like cookies, you can control how local storage works on your browser settings on a global or website specific manner. You can disable local storage or clear it manually at any time.

What happens to data when Documents has been uninstalled?

When you uninstall Documents, logs are removed permanently. Local storage data can be cleared manually in your browser. Information about Documents sign ups is still stored on our servers and can be removed by request. You can send a request to support@plumsail.com.

How do we protect your information?
