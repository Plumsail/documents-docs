Terms
~~~~~

This Service Level Agreement for Plumsail Documents (this “SLA”) is a part of `Plumsail License Agreement <https://plumsail.com/license-agreement/>`_ (the “Agreement”). This SLA applies to the "Cabinet" plan of the Plumsail Documents listed herein (an “Documents”) but does not apply to the rest of pricing plans.

If we do not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for Documents as described in this SLA, then you may be eligible for a credit towards a portion of your monthly service fees. We will not change the terms of your SLA during your subscription period. If you renew the subscription, the current version of SLA will be applied at the time of renewal.

*Error Code* means an indication that an operation has failed, such as an HTTP status code in the 5xx range.

*Downtime* is the time during which the Documents is unavailable to be triggered within a given Documents subscription. Documents is considered unavailable for a given Documents subscription when calls to Documents return Error Codes 5xx or an Error Code 404.

*Incident* means any event or events that result in Downtime.

*SLA Credit* is the percentage of the Monthly Subscription Fees credited to you following Plumsail’s claim approval.

*Monthly Subscription Fees* means the total fees paid by you for Documents that are applied to the month in which an SLA Credit is owed.

In order for Plumsail to consider a claim, you must submit the claim to Plumsail customer support including all information necessary for Plumsail to verify the claim. It includes, but not restricted to: 

- A detailed description of the Incident
- Information about the time and duration of the Incident and Downtime
- Descriptions of your attempts to resolve the Incident at the time of occurrence.

Plumsail must receive the claim by the end of the calendar month following the month in which the Incident occurred. We will evaluate all information reasonably available to us and make a good faith determination of whether Plumsail owes an SLA Credit. We will process claims within 30 days of receipt. You must be in compliance with the Agreement in order to be eligible for an SLA Credit. If we determine that Plumsail owes SLA Credit to you, Plumsail will apply SLA Credit to your Monthly Subscription Fees. 

*Maximum Available Minutes* is the time equal to the billing month.

*Monthly Uptime Percentage* is calculated using the following formula:

.. code::
  
  Monthly Uptime Percentage = (Maximum Available Minutes - Downtime)/(Maximum Available Minutes) x 100

If Monthly Uptime Percentage is less than 99%, SLA Credit equals to 20%
