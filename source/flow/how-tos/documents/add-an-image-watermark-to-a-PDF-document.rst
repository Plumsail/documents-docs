If you find yourself in a need to protect your PDF documents, you may decide to add a watermark to them.

This first article from our "How to use Watermarks in Plumsail Documents" series will let you get started with watermarking PDFs using `Plumsail Documents <https://plumsail.com/documents/>`_ in Microsoft Flow. Here is the list of all the articles in the series:

  1. How to use **an image type** watermark to automatically add a company logo to PDF files and save them in a new folder.

  2. How to use **a text type** watermark to prevent documents dissemination.

So, let us have a look at how to add an image watermark to a document.

Use image type watermark to add a company logo
----------------------------------------------

One of the most effective ways to protect PDFs files or to retain corporate identity across documents is to add the company logo to them. Even if a document is spread further than you intended, the watermark will identify you as the owner.

Imagine, you are storing your company files somewhere in a cloud, for example, OneDrive, and want to add an image watermark to new PDF files.

When a new file is added to a folder Files in OneDrive, we will add an image watermark to it and save it in a new folder named *WatermarkedFiles*.

Here is how our flow will look like:

Let us have a closer look at each step of the flow.

Create the flow
----------------

Flow trigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please navigate to `MS Flow <https://emea.flow.microsoft.com>`_, create a flow and find *OneDrive  —  When a file is created* action. Using this trigger will allow you to start the flow on adding a file into a folder. Set the name of the source folder:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/flow/how-tos/Watermark-new-files-in-a-folder-source-folder.png
    :alt: OneDrive  —  When a file is created action

Get file content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find *Get file content using path* action from *OneDrive* connector. Put here **File Path** from the output of the previous action:

.. image:: ../../_static/img/flow/how-tos/Watermark-new-files-in-a-folder-get-file-content.png
    :alt: OneDrive  —  Get file content using path

Get watermark file content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the file you are going to use as the watermark. We store it in SharePoint. You can use any other connector to get files from your system.

.. image:: ../../_static/img/flow/how-tos/Watermark-new-files-in-a-folder-get-watermark-file-content.png
    :alt: SharePoint  —  Get file content

Add a watermark to PDF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an action from `Plumsail Documents connector <https://plumsail.com/documents>`_.

Choose **Image** type of the watermark. Put **File content** from the output of the *Get file content using path* action into the **Document content** field, and the **File content** from the previous action into the **Image content** field.

We set custom values for **Watermark position, Opacity, Watermark Image** width. You may check detailed information on how to use these and other settings `here <https://plumsail.com/docs/documents/v1.x/flow/actions/document-processing.html#add-image-watermark-to-pdf>`_.

Create file
~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a file in another folder. We used *Create file* action from *OneDrive* connector, but you can save your file in any other cloud service.

So, here is our result document watermarked with a large Plumsail logotype on the background:
