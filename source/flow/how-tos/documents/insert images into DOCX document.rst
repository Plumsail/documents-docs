How to insert images into DOCX document
##################################################################


In this article I'm going to show how to insert images into DOCX document.

`Create DOCX from template connector`_  supports `Picture formatter`_: it resolves URL or base64 string and converts it to an image.
If you need to resize the picture you can specify the size

{{value}:picture(100,100)}

Let's check out a couple of examples.

Picture formatter and base64 string
##################################################################
As it's said you can insert the image using base64 string.

- .. code-block:: json

            {                     
                "value": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAIAAAAA9CAYAAABlamFgAA"
            }  

A common situation is getting photos from the camera in PowerApps or pen input for signatures, converting it to base64 and then inserting into a docx template.
In general, you can insert any image if you can get its base64 code in Micrisoft Flow or even using some third-party services.


Picture formatter and URL
##################################################################

The formatter also accepts URLs, Plumsail Documents support anonymous authentication only. 
To use a link to a picture stored in SharePoint, please, 
create a guest link and replace guestacces.aspx string with download.aspx one. 
Your link should look something like this: https://yourDomain.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/download.aspx?docid=DocID&authkey=AuthKey

- .. code-block:: json

            {                     
                "value": "https://picturesite.com/pics/picture.png"
            }
